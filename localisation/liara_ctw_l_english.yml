EMPIRE_DESIGN_liara_ctw:0 "Commonwealth of Transhumanist Worlds"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_liara_ctw_desc:0 "Formed from an early human colony ship, the Commonwealth is a human society whose primary goal is to advance the development of science. An exceptional education program means that Commonwealth humans are very intelligent, and their mastery of cyberware allows them far easier adaptation to new environments. However, reproduction is no longer a priority for many members, and their widespread use of cyberware is seen as repugnant by many."
